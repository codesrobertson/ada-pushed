# This program is an extension of the "Hello, World!" assignment I created to practice quotation solutions in Ruby. 
# The original assignment (per Ada's instructions) can be found in my ada-pushed repository under hello_world.rb. 
# Paul McCartney's dialogue contained in single quotes; Ruby's is in double quotes. 

# Alternate String Syntax (single and double) 
puts "'Hello, Ruby!'"
puts '"Goodbye."'

# Escaped Syntax 
puts "'Hello, hello!' I don\'t know why you say \'goodbye;\' I say \'hello.\'"
puts "\"This is getting a little uncomfortable, Paul.\""

# Alternative Syntax for Strings
puts %$'You say "yes." I say "no." You say "stop." I say "go, go, go." You say "goodbye." I say "hello."'$
puts %$"'Aloha,' Paul. Ruby out."$
